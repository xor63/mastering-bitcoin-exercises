# 3. Bitcoin Core: The Reference Implementation

Chapter 3 of the book Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition is a highly technical
chapter for setting up a development environment. It walks you through compiling
Bitcoin Core and configuring/running your own node. If you follow the steps and
explore the help documentation as described in the chapter, there's more than
enough exercises to work on.

The last section of that chapter is Alternative Clients, Libraries and Toolkits.
It lists some libraries, clients and toolkits grouped by programming language.
We can work on exercises that use any of these to expand on this chapter. With
your programming language of choice, select the software in the list that you
would like to explore and see if you can do any of the exercises below.
