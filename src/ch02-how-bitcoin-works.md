# 2. How Bitcoin Works

### 2.1 Payment request QR code

Construct a QR code for a payment request with the following details:

* Bitcoin address: "mrCDrCybB6J1vRfbwM5hemdJz73FwDBC8r"
* Amount: "0.00001"
* Label: "Blips and Chitz"
* Message: "Purchase tokens at Blips and Chitz"

Scan the QR code with a QR code reader to verify its contents.

__Reading__: [BIP-21][bip21] is a short proposal that describes the URI scheme
used in payment request QR codes.
