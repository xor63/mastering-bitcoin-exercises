# Style Guide

## Formatting

### Headings

* Use atx-style headings.
* Use level 1 for main title of the page, e.g. chapter title.
* Use level 2 if exercises need to be grouped into sections.
* Use level 3 for exercise numbers, even if there's no level 2 on the page.
* Use title case for chapter/section headings.
* Use sentence case for exercise headings.

### Maximum line width and links

* The maximum width for a line is 80 characters.
* Long URLs can break this rule.
* For links within text, avoid inline links and use reference-style instead.

### Equations

* To allow superscript or subscript, use `<pre>` and `<sup>` or `<sub>`.
* For consistency, use `<pre>` even when there's no superscript or subscript.
* Use four spaces of indentation.
